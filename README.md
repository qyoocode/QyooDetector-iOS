# QyooDetector

QyooDetector is a Swift package that provides image processing capabilities, particularly focused on handling grayscale images. The core functionality includes feature detection, image contrast adjustment, and transformation of images into grayscale. The package leverages Objective-C++ for performance, making it suitable for both modern Swift applications and legacy C++ systems.

## Features

- Grayscale image processing for 8-bit and 32-bit images.
- Conversion of `UIImage` objects to grayscale and feature detection.
- Image contrast scaling for enhancing image clarity.
- Ability to create indexed images using custom color masks.
- Legacy support for server-side C++ image processing using `QYOO_CMD` mode.

## Legacy `QYOO_CMD` Mode

The package includes legacy C++ code that was originally used for server-side processing of images on Linux systems. This mode, activated by the `QYOO_CMD` preprocessor directive, is no longer actively maintained but remains part of the codebase for backward compatibility.

When `QYOO_CMD` is defined, the package relies on the **GD** and **CML** libraries for server-side image processing, including:
- Saving and flipping images in the GD image format (`gdImagePtr`).
- Matrix transformations using CML (`cml::matrix`).

This code was used to perform server-side processing of image data on a Linux server but has since been replaced by more modern approaches using Swift and UIKit for iOS/macOS applications.

## Installation

### Using Swift Package Manager

To integrate **QyooDetector** into your project, you can add it as a dependency using Swift Package Manager.

1. In your Xcode project, go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.
2. Enter the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/yourusername/QyooDetector.git
   ```
3. Choose the latest version and add it to your target.

Alternatively, you can add the package directly to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/QyooDetector.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Package Structure

The package is divided into two main components:
- **QyooLib**: Contains the Objective-C++ image processing code, which performs the core image manipulation functions.
- **QyooDetector**: Swift-based interface that exposes the image processing functionality for use in Swift projects.

### Key Classes and Methods

#### `RawImageGray8`

This class handles 8-bit grayscale image data.

- **Initialization**:
  ```objc
  RawImageGray8 *image = [[RawImageGray8 alloc] initWithSizeX:100 sizeY:100];
  ```
  
- **Render from `UIImage`**:
  Converts a `UIImage` to a raw grayscale image:
  ```objc
  [image renderFromImage:uiImage flip:NO vertFlip:NO];
  ```

- **Image Contrast**:
  Enhances the contrast of the grayscale image:
  ```objc
  [image runContrast];
  ```

- **Convert back to `UIImage`**:
  Generates a `UIImage` from the raw grayscale data:
  ```objc
  UIImage *outputImage = [image makeImageWithCopy:YES];
  ```

#### `RawImageGray32`

This class handles 32-bit grayscale image data.

- **Initialization**:
  ```objc
  RawImageGray32 *image = [[RawImageGray32 alloc] initWithSizeX:100 sizeY:100];
  ```

- **Create a `UIImage`**:
  ```objc
  UIImage *outputImage = [image makeImageWithZeroAlpha:NO];
  ```

## Legacy `QYOO_CMD` Mode

When building the package for use in a Linux or server-side environment, you can define `QYOO_CMD` to use the original C++ image processing code. This mode relies on the **GD** and **CML** libraries and is primarily intended for legacy use cases where server-side image processing is required.

### Key Methods in `QYOO_CMD` Mode:
- **GD Image Manipulation**:
  ```cpp
  gdImagePtr image = gdCreateImage(sizeX, sizeY);
  RawImageGray8.copyFromGDImage(image);
  ```

- **Matrix Transformations** (for scaling or rotating images):
  ```cpp
  QyooMatrix mat;
  RawImageGray8.copyFromGDImage(image, mat);
  ```

> **Note:** This mode is no longer actively maintained and is only kept for backward compatibility with older systems.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the package in a Swift-based iOS/macOS project:

```swift
import QyooLib

class ImageProcessor {
    func processImage(_ image: UIImage) -> UIImage? {
        let rawImage = RawImageGray8(sizeX: Int(image.size.width), sizeY: Int(image.size.height))
        rawImage.renderFromImage(image, flip: false, vertFlip: false)
        rawImage.runContrast()
        return rawImage.makeImageWithCopy(true)
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot find 'RawImageGray8' in scope**:
   Ensure that the `QyooLib` target is correctly added as a dependency in your Swift Package, and make sure the public headers are exposed.

2. **Undefined symbols when using `QYOO_CMD`**:
   Make sure the **GD** and **CML** libraries are installed on your Linux system if you're using the package in server-side mode.
